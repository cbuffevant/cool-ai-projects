# Cool AI Projects
Cool AI Projects worth keeping an eye on them

* [Hyperopt: Distributed Asynchronous Hyper-parameter Optimization](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt): Hyperopt is a Python library for serial and parallel optimization over awkward search spaces, which may include real-valued, discrete, and conditional dimensions.

* [Yandex CatBoost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost): A fast, scalable, high performance Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees library, used for ranking, classification, regression and other machine learning tasks for Python, R, Java, C++. Supports computation on CPU and GPU.

## [DMTK](http://github.com/microsoft/dmtk) ##
* [Light Gradient Boosting Machine](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM): A fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting (GBT, GBDT, GBRT, GBM or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. It is under the umbrella of the DMTK(http://github.com/microsoft/dmtk) project of Microsoft.


## [Distributed (Deep) Machine Learning Community](https://github.com/dmlc) ##
* [**R**eliable **A**llreduce and **B**roadcast **I**nterface](https://github.com/dmlc/rabit): Rabit is a light weight library that provides a fault tolerant interface of Allreduce and Broadcast. It is designed to support easy implementations of distributed machine learning programs, many of which fall naturally under the Allreduce abstraction. The goal of rabit is to support portable , scalable and reliable distributed machine learning programs.

* [eXtreme Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost): Scalable, Portable and Distributed Gradient Boosting (GBDT, GBRT or GBM) Library, for Python, R, Java, Scala, C++ and more. Runs on single machine, Hadoop, Spark, Flink and DataFlow

## Apache ##
* [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/): A flexible and efficient library for deep learning.

* [Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/): Apache Mahout(TM) is a distributed linear algebra framework and mathematically expressive Scala DSL designed to let mathematicians, statisticians, and data scientists quickly implement their own algorithms.
